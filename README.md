# SEM_for_cross-sectional_data
This repository includes the sintax and dataset to suppor the book chapter "Best practices in Structural Equation Modeling for cross-sectional data on emerging adults" by Tiago Ferreira, Filipa Nunes, & Paula Mena Matos

## Chapter content
Structural equation modeling (SEM) refers to a family of related procedures that are commonly applied in research with emerging adults. As the methodology of SEM is constantly evolving, there is always a need of up-to-date guidelines for building and testing SEM models. This chapter will provide an overview of best practices in using SEM for building and testing models on cross-sectional data. In doing so, it will discuss the basic components of SEM: model specification, identification, estimation, evaluation, and interpretation. It will also do so in an accessible way and by providing examples of studies with emerging adults. Additionally, this chapter will provide a list of resources for further understanding SEM and the extensions of SEM.
